# Package Management

## Workspace Configuration

This project uses pnpm workspaces for package management. The main configuration files are:

- [pnpm-workspace.yaml](mdc:pnpm-workspace.yaml) - Defines workspace package locations
- [.npmrc](mdc:.npmrc) - NPM and pnpm configuration
- [package.json](mdc:package.json) - Root package dependencies and scripts

## Dependency Management

- Dependencies are locked in [pnpm-lock.yaml](mdc:pnpm-lock.yaml)
- Workspace packages are organized in:
  - `apps/*` - Application packages
  - `packages/*` - Shared library packages
  - `libraries/*` - Additional library packages

## Version Management

The project uses Changesets for version management:
- Changesets are stored in the `.changeset` directory
- Version bumps and changelogs are managed through the Changesets workflow
